# Laplaican PDE Continuous and Discretized Solutions
This small Mathematica notebook can be run to generates a 3D visualization of a solution to a Laplacian partial differential equation. The derivation for the equation is written out in full in the referenced paper (currently not published). The second plot is the visualization of the discretization utilizing meshes scaled from 2^1 to 2^5.
